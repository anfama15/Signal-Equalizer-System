Corrupt an audio Signal with 2khz noise and use various filtering techniques to filter it.

1.	NOTCH FILTER POLE ZERO APPROACH:
Every digital filter can be specified by its poles and zeros (together with a gain factor). Poles and zeros give useful insights into a filter's response, and can be used as the basis for digital filter design.

2.	BANDSTOP BUTTERWORTH FILTER: 
A Band Stop Filter allows a specific range of frequencies to not pass to the output, while allowing lower and higher frequencies to pass with little attenuation and The Butterworth filter is a type of signal processing filter designed to have a frequency response that is as flat as possible in the passband. It is also referred to as a maximally flat magnitude filter.

3.	LOWPASS BUTTERWORTH FILTER: 
The low pass Butterworth filter is an active Low pass filter as it consists of the op-amp. This op-amp operates on non-inverting mode. Hence, the gain of the filter will decide by the resistor R1 and RF. And the cutoff frequency decides by R and C .

4.	HIGH PASS BUTTERWORTH FILTER:
The high pass Butterworth filter is an active high pass filter as it consists of the op-amp. This op-amp operates on non-inverting mode. Hence, the gain of the filter will decide by the resistor R1 and RF. And the cutoff frequency decides by R and C.
